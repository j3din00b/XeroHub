### What is XeroLinux

In a nutshell, this ISO bundles all my scripts, toolkit, and custom rice into a seamless, easy-to-install package, skipping the hassle of running the **ArchInstall** script entirely. No more, no less.

You can easily configure everything using the built-in [**Xero Toolkit**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/xlapit/), just look for the first icon with my logo in the Dock. Keep in mind, though, that some features have already been applied in the ISO, so you're all set for a smooth experience from the start.

Since **XeroLinux** uses **KDE Plasma**, a DE that isn't very lightweight. Though it technically *will* work on low end hardware, performance will not be that great. See requirements below.

**Minimum**

- 4GB RAM (DDR3+)
- 16GB HDD/SSD Storage
- Modern iGPU (512MB vRAM)

**Recommended**

- 8GB+ RAM (DDR3+)
- 32GB+ HDD/SSD Storage
- Modern dGPU (4GB+ vRAM)

What it isn't, is a distribution like **Ubuntu** or **Mint** that takes care of everything for you. While I’ve taken care of the main setup process and included the *Toolkit*, things like drivers and additional configuration, making it your own will be up to you. That’s the essence of **ArchLinux**, a *Do-It-Yourself* distro. If the appearance led you to believe otherwise, I apologize, as that wasn’t the intention.

### How To get ISO

In order to get it, please click the button below to get redirected to the **Ko-Fi Store** page where you will be able to donate however much you want starting from $6 onwards, and you will receive a confirmation e-mail, with a link to a special directory containing the ISO on [**Mega.nz**](https://mega.nz) with the Decryption key required to access it.

If you prefer not to, or can't,it's not an issue at all. You can always use the included  **ArchInstall** in combination with my [**PlasmaInstall**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/plasma/) scripts to achieve a *similar* result.

It will be a bit more complex, but will never cost you anything and the code will forever be made available to fork and modify to your liking.

### Wrapping up

This project depends on you. The more support I get, the longer it will live for. I cannot, due to my situation, keep maintaining something like this for free, it costs money. Hosting, Internet, and so on. I hope you understand.

We highly recommend the use of **Ventoy** to boot, so you have **Grub** as fallback in case **SystemD-Boot** fails. If you burn using **Etcher** or similar tools there will be nothing to fall back to. Just an FYI.

With that, I sure hope you enjoy it, and let me know how it goes. For support feel free to join my personal and free [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu). I will do my best to help.
