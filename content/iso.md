### What is it?

As you can see, I have decided to revive the Distro. Only this time it's a bit different. Read on to know more.

In short, it's just an alternative to the **XeroLinux Plasma Install** script, making it easier to install **Arch**, bypassing the need for **ArchInstall**. The ISO includes my toolkit as well as my famous **XeroLayan** rice all-in-one shot.

You can use the included **Post-Install Toolkit**, 1st icon with my logo in the Dock, to configure it, keeping in mind that some of the features were already applied to the ISO. I have also taken the liberty of including the [**Chaotic-AUR**](https://aur.chaotic.cx) repository so it's easier for you to install **AUR** packages rather from having to compile them.

### Who ist it for?

It's for all of you out there who prefer an easier way to install **Arch** and **KDE**, and feel like supporting my work financially while getting something in return. If you don't feel like, or can't do that, you can always use **ArchInstall** in combination with my **PlasmaInstall** scripts to achieve the same result.

It will be a bit more complex, but in this case it will never cost you anything and the code will forever be made available to fork and modify to your liking.

The ISO will forever be offered **AS IS**, no further features will be added, simply because I still strongly believe in freedom of choice. Nothing will be forced on you no matter what. You are free to shape the Distro however you want making it truly yours.

All I ask for is for you not to share it with anyone. Otherwise you will be hurting the project making it harder for me to maintin. I am only one man doing all this for you, not a team. Thanks you for being supportive.

### Wrapping up

This project depends on you now. The more support I get, the longer it will live for. I cannot, due to my situation, keep maintaining something like this for free, it costs money. Hosting, Internet, and so on. I hope you understand.

I sure hope you enjoy it, and let me know how it goes. For support feel free to join my personal and free [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu). I will do my best to help.
