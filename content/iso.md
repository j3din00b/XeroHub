### What is XeroLinux

In short, it's just an alternative to the [**Plasma Install Script**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/plasma/) script, making it easier to install **Arch**, bypassing the need for **ArchInstall**. The ISO includes my toolkit as well as my famous [**Xero Layan Rice**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/rice/) rice all-in-one shot.

You can use the included [**Xero Toolkit**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/xlapit/), 1st icon with my logo in the Dock, to configure it, keeping in mind that some of the features were already applied to the ISO.

What it isn't, is a distribution like **Ubuntu** or **Mint** that takes care of everything for you. While I’ve taken care of the main setup process and included the *Toolkit*, things like drivers and additional configuration, making it your own will be up to you. That’s the essence of **ArchLinux**, a *Do-It-Yourself* distro. If the appearance led you to believe otherwise, I apologize, as that wasn’t the intention.

### Who is Distro for

It's designed for those who appreciate the *Do-It-Yourself* (DIY) approach, with an easier way to install **Arch** and the **KDE** Desktop Environment, while also offering a way to support my work financially and get something in return. A big thanks to those who choose to contribute!

If you prefer not to, or can't,it's not an issue at all. You can always use the included  **ArchInstall** in combination with my **PlasmaInstall** scripts to achieve a *similar* result.

It will be a bit more complex, but will never cost you anything and the code will forever be made available to fork and modify to your liking.

All I ask for, is for you not to share it with anyone. Otherwise you will be hurting the project making it harder for me to maintain. I am only one man doing all this for you, not a team. Thank you for being supportive.

### Wrapping up

This project depends on you. The more support I get, the longer it will live for. I cannot, due to my situation, keep maintaining something like this for free, it costs money. Hosting, Internet, and so on. I hope you understand.

We highly recommend the use of **Ventoy** to boot, so you have **Grub** as fallback in case **SystemD-Boot** fails. If you burn using **Etcher** or similar tools there will be nothing to fall back to. Just an FYI.

With that, I sure hope you enjoy it, and let me know how it goes. For support feel free to join my personal and free [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu). I will do my best to help.
