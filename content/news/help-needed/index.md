Hey there...

This is a new type of post. Please read on to understand what it's all about. **XeroLinux** needs your help.

### Designers needed

We here, at the **XeroLinux HQ** are looking for designers who will help us bring life to our upcoming **Merch Store**. Yes, you read this right, we are looking to expand our portfolio, adding in some cool merch that everyone can purchase, as an alternative or additinal way to support the project. I have seen a lot of users liking the idea.

I am no designer, so no clue where to start, nor do I have a hight quality logo to start with, just a very low quality one, maybe it can be used for inspiration. Also I am not looking at offering every type of item under the sun, just a few that might be interesting for the **FOSS** oriented crowd.

We can discuss the text that will be used in the logo and on the various designs once we begin. But to start I was thinking maybe we could use **"I use XeroLinux BTW"** as a base quote, what do you think ?

### Service Chosen

The service I have chosen is [**FourthWall**](https://fourthwall.com). I chose this one because Matt from [**TheLinuxCast**](https://thelinuxcast.org) recommended it, and I trust his choice. I am new to all this, so I have idea what am doing. That's why your help is needed.

I know of many other services out there, I just don't know which one offers the most value when it comes to such things. I have already set up the domain, and paghe design, so now all that's missing is the actual merch. I have no clue where to begin. let's do it step-by-step. I already have so many things I am working on right now lol.

### Compensation

Well, since I am based in Lebanon, it will be very difficult for me to pay you directly for any services rendered. However we can always reach some sort of understading. We can always dicuss the matter behind the scenes.

### Wrapping up

So now that you know what we are looking for, and are interested, feel free to contact me either on [**Fosstodon**](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux) or by emailing me directly via this [**E-mail**](mailto:techxero@vivaldi.net?subject=XeroLinux%20Merch%20Design). I am looking forward to our collab should it happen.

Cheers !
