### The Toolkit.

This toolkit aims to be an _all-in-one_ solution for post-installation, expediting your Arch setup. Check out the [**Wiki**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/xlapit/) for more detailed information.

### Xero-Layan Rice

It's the best **KDE** rice I have ever created, in my opinion. If you want to enjoy said rice on your system, check out the [**Wiki**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/rice/) ðŸ˜€

### Xero-Plasma Install Script

With the help of this script you will be able to install **Plasma** in one of 4 methods as you can see in the image below. For more info check out the [**Wiki**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/plasma/)

### Wrapping up

While my tools are great and offer amazing flexibility and total freedom of choice, they are not intended for everyone. For one, they only target **ArchLinux** with a profile fix just for **KDE Plasma**, for two, they heavily rely on your knowledge in using **Linux**.

If you prefer the GUI route, you can always check out our Distro or any other one for that matter. There is no harm in doing that. It's all about choice. I will never force you to use my tools. You are entitled to your own preferences. Who am I to judge you for your choices ?

In case you are as much of a *Linux G33k* as I am, then those tools were created with you in mind.

Have fun & let me know how it goes.
