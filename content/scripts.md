### Information

In the course of my **Linux** journey, I decided to put my knowledge into useful scripts. Providing ways to set up various DEs, Themes, and even a full fledged *Post-Install Toolkit* for easy **Arch Setup**.

While my tools are great and offer amazing flexibility and total freedom of choice, they are not intended for everyone. For one, they only target **ArchLinux**, for two, they heavily rely on your knowledge in using **Linux**.

### The Scripts

Explore the following notable Xero scripts :

6. **Xero Layan Rice** => [🌐 Visit the Wiki](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/rice/)

### Wrap up

If you prefer the GUI route, you can always check out our Distro or any other one for that matter. There is no harm in doing that. It's all about choice. I will never force you to use my tools. You are entitled to your own preferences. Who am I to judge you for your choices ?

In case you are as much of a *Linux G33k* as I am, then those tools were created with you in mind.

Have fun & let me know how it goes 😀
