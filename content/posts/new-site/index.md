### Not Again !

Yep, again lol... I dunno what else to say. I will keep trying different designs out until I am satisfied. But if all goes well, this will be the last time, who knows ? FOr now enjoy the new look n feel. I really hope you like it. I need to thank [**Zaney**](https://zaney.org) for letting me know about this awesome theme. I am still figuring it out as I go. If you can help feel free to let me know.

### What is it ?

Well, if you do not know, this site is using [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io) with a theme called [**Blowfish**](https://blowfish.page). Great combo if you ask me. So many features to go through. I did not even scratch the surface yet. Things will get better soon.

### What about your other blog ?

That's a tricky question. Consider the other blog as my journal, where I post my thoughts and feelings about things that are happening in the **FOSS** world. Here I will be posting updates related to my various projects, as well as some other **Open Source** news/articles. However guides will be on [**Forums**](https://forum.xerolinux.xyz).

I know this might be a lot to take in. I am trying to organize things to the best of my abilities. In the future, if the project survives these hard times, I will consider putting everything under one site, this one. Getting rid of my "journal" as well as forums. I do not know yet, time will tell.

### Closing words

Until then let me know what you think of this new look. If you have any suggestions or ideas on how I can make it all better feel free to let me know how. Thanks for reading this. Here's to future posts...

Cheers :heart:
