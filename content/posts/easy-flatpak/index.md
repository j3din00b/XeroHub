### What is it?

**Easy Flatpak** will help you install Flatpak apps in a user-friendly way. It provides recipes for some of them to install them even better. More in video below. It's in French, so use subs.

For example, for Steam, it asks the user to choose a folder where they store their games before installation.

### Closing words

I use Flatpaks for almost everything. This app made things even better. It's the first of its kind and hope it continues to develop. I recommend it to everyone...

It's that simple!!
