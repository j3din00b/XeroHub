### Description

With **XeroLinux** no longer being a Distro, but a collection of _Projects/Scripts_, created with a simple goal in mind, making [**ArchLinux**](https://archlinux.org) more approachable, easier to install and configure. That's if you choose to use it, or even give it a try.

Don't forget to [follow me](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux) on Fosstodon.

Our job from now on, on this site, is, to bring you the most useful **FOSS** tools and guides alongside our various projects as we work on them. It's your one-stop shop for those kinds of posts.

As mentioned on a dedicated post, we will not be posting any news, Distro reviews and Vs. articles to avoid any drama, and because news tend to get old real fast. Also we try to avoid opinionated posts as much as we can.

Anyway enjoy your stay here ;)

### ArchLinux / KDE Plasma

I have so many great ideas in the pipeline, it's crazy ! I love working with **ArchLinux**. It's the most flexible Distro I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Allowing me to build things from the ground up without it being too complex, or getting in my way.

I also love working with **KDE Plasma**, simply because it's so damn beautiful, and easy to work with. And since I am more of a visual old geezer, it fits my needs so well it ain't a joke. That's why I don't see myself using anything else for a long time to come.

I do dabble with other Distros from time to time to keep my knowledge fresh however. And if I like what I see, you will see me talking about it here.

Cheers y'all ðŸ˜€
