### Description

With **XeroLinux** no longer being a Distro, but a collection of _Projects/Scripts_, created with a simple goal in mind, making [**ArchLinux**](https://archlinux.org) more approachable, easier to install and configure. That's if you choose to use it, or even give it a try.

### Point of this site

Our job from now on, on this site, is, to bring you the most useful **FOSS** tools and guides alongside our various projects as we work on them. It's your one-stop shop for those kinds of posts.

As mentioned on a dedicated post, we will not be posting any news, Distro reviews and Vs. articles to avoid any drama, and because news tend to get old real fast. Also we try to avoid opinionated posts as much as we can.

I have so many great ideas in the pipeline, it's crazy !

### XeroLinux Equipment & OS

- **Linux Distro :**

I love working with **ArchLinux**. It's the most flexible Distro I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Allowing me to build things from the ground up without it being too complex, or getting in my way.

- **Desktop Environment :**

I also love working with **KDE Plasma**, simply because it's so damn beautiful, and easy to work with. And since I am more of a visual old geezer, it fits my needs so well it ain't a joke. That's why I don't see myself using anything else for a long time to come.

I do dabble with other Distros from time to time to keep my knowledge fresh however. And if I like what I see, you will see me talking about it here.

- **Current System Specs :**

I do own many, 3 Desktops and 1 Laptop. Main, Home-Lab & HTPC. Laptop is unimportant just runs my shop.

**The Beast :**

Main rig, the one I do all my *Development*, *Gaming* and other things on, which I label as **StationXero**, runs **ArchLinux** with **KDE Plasma**.

I know the `GTX 1080` is an aging GPU, trust me I am trying to raise money to replace it with at least an `RTX 3080/3090`. I could use better **Wayland** support. Am not really a gamer though, so that part I do not perticularly care about.

**Home-Lab :**

Another desktop I call **XeroLab**, as the name implies, is my **Home-Lab** PC, it runs all my **Docker Containers**. The OS it runs is the last surviving instance of **XeroLinux** `~780` Days running. It has `32GB RAM` with a `Core i7 6800K` and an old P.O.S `GT-710` GPU that I will be replacing as soon as I can raise the money for one.

That thing has survived many failed `nvidia-470xx` driver updates, but I finally decided with how old GPU is to stick with `nouveau` open source drivers.

**The HTPC :**

Finally there's my HTPC, which has the same CPU as **XeroLab**, with a few differences, being the GPU which is a `GTX 650 Ti-Boost OC`, and the `16GB RAM`. Now whith it being my HTPC, it has 14 Drives of various sizes totalling `~68TB` of storage.

As for the OS it has been running for the past **~1300 Days** without any issues, it's [**Manjaro KDE**](https://manjaro.org).. With the only app installed being [**Plex Server**](https://plex.tv) as a *Snap*.

Since I need **Hardware Acceleration** so I am able to encode & decode the movies & TV-Shows I watch, I have no choice but to use the Distro provided **nVidia-470xx** proprietary ones. So far so good, no issues.

That's it folks. Now you have a better idea of what equipment I use on a daily basis to bring you everything I do. I did not list all the softwares I use coz it's a long list that varies a lot. Thanks for reading.

Enjoy your stay here.

Cheers y'all ðŸ˜€
