### Who I Am

My nameâ€™s **Steve**, A.K.A *TechXero/DarkXero*, and I am a 44 year old Tech fanatic from **Lebanon**. I love technology. I am a *Multi-OS* User, as in, I donâ€™t stick to one Platform, I like to dabble in all of them. I currently use **iOS** and **Android** when it comes to *Smartphones*. **macOS**, **Windows** and **Linux** when it comes to *Desktop Operating Systems*.

**Personal Site :** To know more about me, my likes/dislikes, and other juicy details, visit my [**Personal Site**](https://techxero.com).

I have been using **Gnu/Linux** since 2019. In 2020 I decided to create **XeroLinux** to satisfy my needs. After sharing it with some friends, they convinced me to make it public, and the rest is history as they say...

### Point of this site

This site sheds light on some of the most useful **FOSS** tools and guides alongside our various projects as we work on them. It's your one-stop shop for those kinds of posts.

As mentioned on a dedicated post, we will not be posting any Distro reviews or Vs. articles to avoid any drama. Also we try to avoid opinionated posts as much as we can.

Enjoy your stay here.

Cheers y'all ðŸ˜€
